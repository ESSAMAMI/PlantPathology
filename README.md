# **Project : PLANT PATHOLOGY** :four_leaf_clover:

Objectives of ‘Plant Pathology Challenge’ are to train a model using 
images of training dataset to 1) Accurately classify a given image from 
testing dataset into different diseased category or a healthy leaf; 2) 
Accurately distinguish between many diseases, sometimes more than one on 
a single leaf; 3) Deal with rare classes and novel symptoms; 4) Address 
depth perception—angle, light, shade, physiological age of the leaf; and 
5) Incorporate expert knowledge in identification, annotation, 
quantification, and guiding computer vision to search for relevant 
features during learning.
